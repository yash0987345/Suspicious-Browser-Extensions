Suspicious-Browser-Extensions

1. AdBlox
Reason for Concern:
  - Collects extensive data: IP address, location, URLs visited, OS, browser, user agent, HTTP codes, etc.
  - Infers age and gender — unnecessary for an ad blocker.
  - Privacy policy mentions user tracking and demographic profiling.

 Action Taken: Removed


2. VPN для Chrome – VPN Satoshi
Reason for Concern**:
  - Only 3.3star rating with negative reviews (“not working”, “no free locations”).
  - Handles authentication and location data — sensitive permissions.
  - Suspicious Russian title and unknown publisher.
  
Action Taken: Removed


-> What I Learned

- Not all ad blockers or VPNs are trustworthy.
- Privacy policies and extension permissions can reveal hidden data collection practices.
- It's important to verify extension ratings, permissions, and publisher info** before installation.
- Extensions requesting unnecessary permissions (like demographics or full browsing data) may be harmful.
